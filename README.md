Issues
During this assignment, Koala was being weird - it would constantly freeze up and crash, and sometimes it would open up dozens of windows and slow my computer down. Every time I had to force quit Koala, the main.css file would wipe out, so for a split second until main.css transpiled again, all the styling would be all cleared.

Also, I had trouble getting the multiple styles on "Dine-In or Takeout" to look good together. I used flex to move them together, but when I tried to add padding to space them out a bit more, nothing would happen.

Resources
I used the lectures to help with this assignment.
